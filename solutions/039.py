"""Project Euler 39

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, 
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p  1000, is the number of solutions maximised?


Discussion: To solve this, I did a bit of searching on wikipedia on
pythagorean triples. I think the quickest way to find a solution is to parse a
list of triples and see what the most common sum of the triples are.
